Hello,

Just unpack the .zip into a directory and use the make command

Usage: ./Scheduler <input-file>

The output into console that contains the original file has been disabled, renable it by uncommenting line 62

The output files have the naming syntax of <algo-name>2 ex. FCFS2 will contain the output of FCFS
