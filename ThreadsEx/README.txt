Hello and welcome to my README! 

Here you will find many valuable things needed to run my program.

To Run:
    1. Navigate to the folder you've put this in.
    2. In the terminal either type "make" or "make all" to compile
    3. Syntax for running program is "java ProducerConsumer"
    4. Run "make clean" to delete everything but the Makefile and ProducerConsumer.java
    5. (Optional) If you'd like a zip file of the project use "make package"
    
Good Luck!
