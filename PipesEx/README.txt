Hello and welcome to my README! 

Here you will find many valuable things needed to run my program.

To Run:
    1. Navigate to the folder you've put this in.
    2. In the terminal either type "make" or "make all" to compile
    3. Syntax for running program is "./coordinator <int> <int> <int> <int> <int>"
    4. (Optional) If you'd like a zip file of the project use "make package"
    
Good Luck!
